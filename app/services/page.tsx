          bodyText="Electric panels are the first line of defense against electrical fires. If too many devices are plugged into the same circuit, exceeding the safe limit, the breaker will trip to make sure that the wire does not overheat and start a fire. But circuit breakers can wear out over time, be damaged by lightning strikes, even a mouse might chew through a wire, or other hidden issues could arise. These can cause a breaker to trip and make it impossible to reset. Many older homes are still relying on outdated circuit breakers that do not offer the same protections as modern ones such as arc fault and ground fault protection. We have even come across some homes still relying on fuse panels, like the one pictured here, which were installed in the 1950s or earlier! If you aren't sure about your home's electric panel, now might be a good time to have a routine maintenance inspection done. Call Wilson's Wires today for a routine inspection and peace of mind."

This is not only a matter of comfort, but is also essential to keeping you and your belongings safe from harmful mold. Even though our winters are short, they can feel terribly cold due to the high humidity. Mini-splits are a type of heat pump that can cool or heat your home very efficiently. They are more visually appealing than window air-conditioners and they don't block your windows, meaning you can still enjoy a refreshing breeze when it is nice outside. Because mini splits can work in reverse to heat your home, they will free you from relying on traditional space heaters which pose a fire hazard and are a common cause of overloaded circuits in old homes. They also give you the ability to control the temperature of each room of your house independently. Call today for more info on mini split installation."

As a result, the number of places throughout the home where they are required has been extended substantially since they were first introduced. Still, many old homes do not adequately take advantage of this simple yet life-saving technology. The ground wire in an electrical circuit is the emergency back up system. It provides power a safe route back to the service panel in case a live wire comes into contact with something it should not. Under normal circumstances, the ground wire should not be carrying electricity, but if it is this will not cause a standard circuit breaker to trip. That's where GFCIs come in. They detect when power is leaking or the emergency back up system is being used and when to shut down the circuit. This is especially important in kitchens, bathrooms, garages, and any area where electrical outlets may be exposed to moisture.
